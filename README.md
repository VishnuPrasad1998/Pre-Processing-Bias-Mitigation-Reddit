# ðŸ§  Gender, Orientation, and Race Data Processing & Debiasing

This project focuses on bias mitigation using two distinct methods: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and prompt tuning. CDA was applied to a Reddit dataset to reduce representational bias through augmented counterfactual examples. In parallel, prompt tuning was performed on synthetically generated data to steer model outputs toward fairer representations. Together, these approaches demonstrate complementary strategies for addressing bias in language models.

## ðŸ“š Notebooks Included

### ðŸ§© 1. Data Creation & Processing

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/CDA/Data preperation/gender_creation_and_processing.ipynb` | Creates and processes a dataset centered around gender attributes. |
| `/CDA/Data preperation/orientation_data_set_creation_and_processing.ipynb` | Handles the creation and preprocessing of a dataset focusing on sexual orientation. |
| `/CDA/Data preperation/race_data_set_creation_and_processing.ipynb` | Generates and processes a dataset based on racial attributes. |
| `/Prompt Tuning/ptuning_dataset_creation.ipynb` | This notebook focuses on synthetically creating datasets tailored for prompt tuning (p-tuning) tasks. It prepares data in a format suitable for fine-tuning language models using soft prompts, which can be especially useful in low-resource or task-specific NLP scenarios.|

### ðŸ§¹ 2. Debiasing (CDA - Counterfactual Data Augmentation)

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/CDA/Debias/Debias_gender.ipynb` | Focuses on detecting and reducing bias related to **gender** in datasets using CDA.|
| `/CDA/Debias/Debias_orientation.ipynb` | Focuses on detecting and reducing bias related to **sexual orientation** in datasets using CDA.|
| `/CDA/Debias/Debias_race.ipynb` | Focuses on detecting and reducing bias related to **race** in datasets using CDA.|

### ðŸ¤– 3. Debiasing (Prompt Tuning)

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/Prompt Tuning/PromptTuningNew.ipynb` | Demonstrates **prompt tuning** to reduce bias in text outputs from language models. Great for NLP applications involving identity-sensitive prompts. |
